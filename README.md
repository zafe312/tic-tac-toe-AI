# tic-tac-toe-AI
This is a simple tic-tac-toe AI which uses minimax algorithm in python. Download the required files with of the game with informations regarding installation as-well-as the minimax algorithm from [here](https://github.com/wncc/SoC-Winter/tree/main/tic-tac-toe). Put the 'tictactoe.py' file in the same folder as the other downloaded files. Then run the python script named 'runner.py' available in the given link.

This script uses minimax algorithm without alpha/beta prunning. A pseudocode with nice explanation of the minimax algorithm used can be found [here](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax). Can you win against the AI?
