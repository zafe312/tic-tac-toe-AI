# tic-tac-toe-AI
This is a simple tic-tac-toe AI in python which uses minimax algorithm to play 'perfectly'. Download the required files with of the game with informations regarding installation of pygame as-well-as the minimax algorithm from [here](https://github.com/wncc/SoC-Winter/tree/main/tic-tac-toe). Put the 'tictactoe.py' file in the same folder as the other downloaded files. Then run the python script named 'runner.py' available in the given link.

For windows users see [here](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) for installation of pygame.

This script uses minimax algorithm without alpha/beta prunning. A pseudocode with nice explanation of the minimax algorithm used can be found [here](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax). Can you win against the AI? Check it out yourself.
